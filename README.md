# Streamlit Starter

- Pull down this repo to get started with a streamlit template


# Python Environment Setup
Activate your virtual environment and make sure you have installed Streamlit

If using conda you can run:
  - `conda install streamlit`

Any others can use:
  - `pip install streamlit`

# Running the App Locally
Run `streamlit run app.py` from the command line.

If you receive a `streamlit.cli` error try running:
  -   `python -m streamlit run app.py`


# Run using Poetry
This repo also utilizes poetry for package management. 
I recommend creating a conda environment using python=3.11 and then run `poetry install`
